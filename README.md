# dotfiles

I've built up a lot of [dotfiles](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2019/dotfiles/), config and preferences over the years as I've tuned my machine to my needs. It would be a shame to lose all of that work.

This repo is an attempt to capture all of that config, and make it possible to quickly recreate my environment on a new machine.

## Using this repo

To set yourself up on a new machine, run `./fre.sh` and take a look at the [checklist](./docs/checklist.md).
