# dotfiles

I've built up a lot of custom [dotfiles](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2019/dotfiles/) over the years. This repo is an attempt to capture all of that config, and make it quickly transferrable to new/remote machines.

## Installing

```sh
sh install.sh
```

To install [additional software via cask](./files/Brewfile.casks), add the `--casks` flag to the install command.
